# Neural Network Lesson

Code in this repository is all adapted from Make Your Own Neural Network (2016) by Tariq Rashid (https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork) for the purpose of free secondary lessons through Science World BC. 

To use, go to kaggle.com and make a new notebook. Import the code for part 1 directly from github (search for hascienceworld). Training and testing .csv files are saved in datasets "SW MNIST Small" and "SW MNIST Large". Use whichever files are preferable and optimal for desired network size and training time. Add these to your project from the "Add Input" button on the sidebar.

Two sample images (one clean, one noisy) are in the kaggle dataset "SW sample images".

For part 1, import the Part 1 file directly from github (search for hascienceworld) on the kaggle notebook. For all other parts, just copy the relevant code from the files on github into your kaggle notebook. (The files only contain the code changes, not the entirety of the necessary code.)

To test on your own images or work from a saved neural network, you will need to make your own dataset on kaggle; you can do that directly from the notebook. Instead of adding a pre-existing dataset, select "Upload".
