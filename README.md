# Neural Network Lesson

Code in this repository is all adapted from Make Your Own Neural Network (2016) by Tariq Rashid (https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork) for the purpose of free secondary lessons through Science World BC. 

To use, go to kaggle.com and make a new notebook. Import the code for part 1 directly from github (search for hascienceworld). Training and testing .csv files should load directly when you run the cell to load the datasets, but you can manually add them by going to "Add Input" and searching for SW MNIST Small" or "SW MNIST Large". Use whichever files are preferable and optimal for desired network efficiency.

Sample images are in the kaggle dataset "SW sample images".

For parts 2-5, just copy the relevant code from the files on github into your kaggle notebook. (The files only contain the code changes, not the entirety of the necessary code.)

To test on your own images or work from a saved neural network, you will need to make your own dataset on kaggle; you can do that directly from the notebook. Instead of adding a pre-existing dataset, select "Upload".
